        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm a web developer pursuing my Bachelors of Science in Information Technology at Sullivan University, with graduation expected at the end of 2021. I started my web development journey in 2014 with a web design class at PRP high school using Adobe Dreamweaver. I enjoyed using that, but I wanted to take it further.</p>
        <p>I started looking up online how to code. I started with the Google Developers website and their introduction to Web tutorial and created a simple site before diving into Bootstrap and the world of Polymer and WebComponents. It was a crazy journey till I understood it enough to build some cool things, mainly with Bootstrap at the time. I took on a challenge to rebuild the PRP website using Bootstrap rather than Dreamweaver. I got very far and completed that. However, JCPS didn't want to use it.</p>
        <p>My teachers and counselors got me entered into the SkillsUSA Web competitions, where I managed to get to nationals on the first try. When I reached nationals, the competition went up a notch. Not only was this based on design and layout at this level, but the site had to function well, be responsive, have good accessibility, and not use any frameworks. It also required you to know how to repurpose .tiff image files into another format for the web. All while only giving you so many hours to complete.</p>
        <p>I competed at Nationals for four years in a row for Web Development, two years in High School, and two years in college. In my last year, I qualified for World Skills! However, because of scheduling, my job at UPS, and attending school at Sullivan University, I couldn't participate at World Skills.</p>
        <p>In the following two years (2017-18), I helped judge the T-Shirt design competition at SkillsUSA Nationals and interned at DBS > Interactive before going back to college to pursue my bachelor's degree.</p>
